Description

The data was extracted from the Human Activity Recognition database available for public use at UCI, built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

A final data set was generated with 3318 observations of 5 variables:

.  Col 1 "subject": Identifier of the subject (one of 30) who carried out the activity

.	Col 2 "activity": Label of the activity performed, one of six levels 
o	LAYING
o	SITTING
o	STANDING
o	WALKING
o	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
o	WALKING_UPSTAIRS

.	Col 3 "variable": Type of measurement taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, one of 79 levels

o	tBodyAcc-XYZ
o	tGravityAcc-XYZ
o	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
o	tBodyGyro-XYZ
o	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
o	tBodyAccMag
o	tGravityAccMag
o	tBodyAccJerkMag
o	tBodyGyroMag
o	tBodyGyroJerkMag
o	fBodyAcc-XYZ
o	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
o	fBodyGyro-XYZ
o	fBodyAccMag
o	fBodyAccJerkMag
o	fBodyGyroMag
o	fBodyGyroJerkMag

.	Col 4 "avg": Mean calculated from measurements in the original data

.	Col 5 "sd": Standard deviation calculated from measurements in the original data
